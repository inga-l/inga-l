### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a MSc Epidemiology student studying at McGill University. 

I am planning to specialize in Infectious Disease Modelling and Health Economics & Outcomes Research.

----------

Other facts that are interesting (or not) about me:

I have a cat whose full name is Gianlorenzo Bernini (and yes I named him after the sculptor).

I speak English and Mandarin. My French and German are functional (at least I think they are). I am also learning Japanese at the moment.

My favourite band is Kent.
